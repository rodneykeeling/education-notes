    "#### Systems of Linear Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **linear equation** can be written in the form $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b$\n",
    "  * where `b` and the coefficients $a_1, ..., a_n$ are real or complex numbers, usually known in advance.\n",
    "  * `n` is any positive integer\n",
    "* Although the following doesn't initially fit the linear equation form, it can be algebraically manipulated to fit the form: \n",
    "  * $ x_2 = 2(\\sqrt{6}-x_1) + x_3 $ => $ 2x_1 + x_2 - x_3 = 2\\sqrt{6} $\n",
    "* A **system of linear equations** (or a **linear system**) is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables ($x_1, ..., x_n$).\n",
    "* A **solution** of the system is a list ($s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$) of numbers that make each equation a true statement when the values ($s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$) are plugged into $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ respectively. \n",
    "* The set of all possible solutions is called the **solution set** of the linear system. Two linear systems are called **equivalent** if they have the same solution set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Notation\n",
    "* Given this system of linear equations:\n",
    "  * $ x_1 - 2x_2 + x_3 = 0 $\n",
    "  * $ 2x_2 - 8x_3 = 8 $\n",
    "  * $ 5x_1 - 5x_3 = 10 $\n",
    "* The **coefficient matrix** (or **matrix of coefficients**) of that system is:\n",
    "  * $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -2 & 1\\\\0 & 2 & -8\\\\5 & 0 & -5\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "* The **augmented matrix** of that system includes the RHS of the equations:\n",
    "  * $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -2 & 1 & 0\\\\0 & 2 & -8 & 8\\\\5 & 0 & -5 & 10\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "* The **size** of a matrix tells its dimensions; if `m` and `n` are positive integers, an **`m x n` matrix** is a matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns.\n",
    "* Solving a linear system involves a few steps:\n",
    "  1. use the $x_1$ term in the first equation to eliminate the $x_1$ terms in the other equations.\n",
    "  2. Then use $x_2$ in the second equation to eliminate the other $x_2$s.\n",
    "  3. Repeat until you obtain a very simple equivalent system of equations.\n",
    "* Or use Python!\n",
    "  * for example:\n",
    "    * $a = \\begin{bmatrix}3 & 1\\\\1 & 2\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "    * $b = \\begin{bmatrix}9 & 8\\end{bmatrix}$"

    "* A **leading entry** of a row refers to the leftmost nonzero entry (of a nonzero row).\n",
    "* A matrix is in **echelon form** if it has the following three properties:\n",
    "  1. All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros.\n",

    "  5. Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.\n",
    "* An **echelon matrix** (or **reduced echelon matrix**) is one that is in echelon form (or reduced echelon form).\n",

    "  * i.e., Span{$v_1,...,v_p$} is the collection of all vectors that can be written in the form $c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_pv_p$ with $c_1,...,c_p$ scalars.\n",
    "* Asking whether a vector `b` is in Span{$v_1,...,v_p$} amounts to asking whether the vector equation, $x_1v_1 + x_2v_2,...,x_pv_p = b$ has a solution.\n",

    "#### The Matrix Equation Ax=b\n",
    "* If `A` is an `m x n` matrix with columns $a_1,...,a_n$ and if `x` is in $\\Bbb R^n$, then the product of `A` and `x` is the linear combination of the columns of `A` using the corresponding entries in `x` as weights:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Solution Sets of Linear Systems\n",
    "* A system of linear equations is said to be **homogeneous** if it can be written in the form `Ax = 0` where `0` is the zero vector in $ \\Bbb R^m $.\n",
    "  * This zero solution (`Ax = 0`) is called the **trivial solution**. \n",
    "  * The important question generally is if there exists a **nontrivial solution**, i.e., a nonzero vector `x` that statisfies `Ax = 0`.\n",
    "* The homogeneous equation `Ax = 0` has a nontrivial solution if and only if the equation has at least one free variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Independence\n",
    "* **Linear independence**: A set of vectors {$v_1,...v_p$} in $\\Bbb R^n$ is linearly independent if the vector equation $ x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + ... + x_pv_p = 0 $ has only the trivial solution.\n",
    "* **Linear dependence**: The set of vectors {$v_1,...v_p$} is linearly dependent if there exists weights $c_1,...,c_p$, not all zero, such that $ c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_pv_p = 0 $"
