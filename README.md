# education-notes
These notes often are not comprehensive and do not represent the documents in their entirety. Sometimes I skip sections because I already feel comfortable with the material; sometimes I take notes despite already feeling comfortable with the material. I'm human, ya know.

Also, Github's `.ipynb` previewer isn't the best, so if you want to check some of these out, be sure to download them and view them in a proper iPython/Jupyter Notebook setting.
