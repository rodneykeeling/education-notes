    "### What is a p-value?\n",
    "\"p-values tell you how _surprising_ the data is, assuming there is no effect.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **p-value**: the probability of getting the observed or more extreme data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After you find a p-value _p < 0.05_, the effect is not 95% likely to be true (this is a common misconception).\n",
    "\n",
    "* You cannot get the probability the null hypothesis is true, given the data, from a p-value. (you need Bayesian statistics for this)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Getting a p-value > 0.05 does not necessarily mean there is _no_ effect. There _could_ be an effect, but this specific data (usually a sample of a population) shows no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A p-value is representative of the data, not necessarily of the theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type 1 and Type 2 Errors\n",
    "* **Type 1 error**: $\\alpha$, the probability of a significant result finding when $H_0$ is true.\n",
    "* **Type 2 error**: $\\beta$, the probability of a non-significant result, given that $H_1$ is true.\n",
    "* **Statistical Power**: $1-\\beta$, the probability of a significant result when $H_1$ is true.\n",
